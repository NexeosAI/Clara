# Model Directory Confirmation Enhancement

## Issue Fixed
When users clicked "Use This Directory" button in the model directory confirmation modal, the button appeared to do nothing - no visual feedback was provided that the action was being processed.

## Solution Implemented

### ðŸ”„ **Loading State Management**
- Added `useState` hook to track loading state in `ConfirmationModal`
- Button shows spinner and changes text when processing
- Both buttons are disabled during async operation

### âœ¨ **Visual Improvements**
- **Before Loading**: "Use This Directory"
- **During Loading**: `ðŸ”„ Setting Directory...` with animated spinner
- **Button States**: Disabled with reduced opacity during loading
- **Error Handling**: Modal stays open if operation fails (shows in console)

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Changes**

#### 1. Updated `ConfirmationModal.tsx`:
```tsx
// Added loading state
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

// Enhanced button with spinner
{isLoading ? (
  <>
    <Loader className="w-4 h-4 animate-spin" />
    Setting Directory...
  </>
) : (
  'Use This Directory'
)}
```

#### 2. Updated `types.ts`:
```tsx
// Support for async onConfirm
onConfirm: () => Promise<void> | void;
```

#### 3. Enhanced Error Handling:
- Wraps async operation in try-catch
- Logs errors to console
- Prevents modal from closing on errors
- Always resets loading state in `finally` block

### âœ… **User Experience**
- **Immediate Feedback**: Button shows spinner as soon as clicked
- **Clear State**: User knows operation is in progress
- **Error Recovery**: Modal remains open if something goes wrong
- **Consistent UI**: Both buttons disabled during operation

### ðŸ”’ **Backward Compatibility**
- Existing `onConfirm` functions continue to work (both sync and async)
- No breaking changes to existing code
- All current usages already use async functions

## Example Flow

1. **User clicks "Use This Directory"**
2. **Button immediately changes to**: `ðŸ”„ Setting Directory...`
3. **Both buttons disabled** (grayed out)
4. **Async operation runs** (setCustomModelPath, notifications, etc.)
5. **On success**: Modal closes, success notification appears
6. **On error**: Modal stays open, error logged to console

This enhancement provides much better user feedback and prevents the confusion of clicking a button that appears to do nothing.
