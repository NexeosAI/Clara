# Network Service Crash Recovery Implementation

## Problem Summary
During llama-cpp startup, the ClaraVerse UI was refreshing/reloading 3 times due to network service crashes in Electron. This caused:
- Loss of user input and application state
- Poor user experience during service initialization
- Repeated rendering cycles that slowed startup

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Network Service Crashes**: Electron's network service was crashing during resource-intensive llama-cpp startup
2. **Multiple Service Restarts**: MCP server restoration conflicts and port cleanup operations triggered additional restarts
3. **Renderer Reloads**: Each network service crash caused the renderer process to reload, losing all React state

## Solution Implementation

### 1. NetworkServiceManager (electron/networkServiceManager.cjs)
- **Purpose**: Handle network service crashes gracefully without triggering renderer reloads
- **Key Features**:
  - Crash detection for network-related errors
  - State preservation before recovery
  - JavaScript injection for seamless state restoration
  - Background recovery without UI interruption

### 2. React State Preservation Hooks (src/hooks/useNetworkResiliency.ts)
- **useNetworkResiliency**: Preserves React state in sessionStorage during crashes
- **useNetworkRecovery**: Handles state restoration after network recovery
- **Features**:
  - Automatic form data backup on beforeunload
  - Custom event system for recovery notifications
  - 30-second recovery window for safety

### 3. Main Process Integration (electron/main.cjs)
- **NetworkServiceManager Integration**: Initialize network crash handling on app startup
- **Prevents**: Default Electron behavior of reloading renderer on network crashes
- **Maintains**: Service functionality while preserving user experience

### 4. LlamaSwap Service Optimization (electron/llamaSwapService.cjs)
- **Efficient Process Cleanup**: Reduced system impact during startup
- **Parallel Operations**: Minimize wait times during port cleanup
- **Targeted Process Management**: Kill only necessary processes to reduce crashes

## Implementation Files

### Created Files:
- `electron/networkServiceManager.cjs` - Core crash recovery system
- `src/hooks/useNetworkResiliency.ts` - React state preservation hooks
- `src/hooks/useNetworkResiliency.test.ts` - Comprehensive test coverage
- `electron/testNetworkResilience.cjs` - Integration testing
- `src/test/setup.ts` - Testing environment setup

### Modified Files:
- `electron/main.cjs` - Added NetworkServiceManager initialization
- `electron/llamaSwapService.cjs` - Optimized process cleanup for efficiency

## Test Results
✅ **All Tests Passing (4/4)**:
1. Network Crash Detection Logic - ✅ PASSED
2. Application State Preservation - ✅ PASSED  
3. Recovery Without Page Reload - ✅ PASSED
4. Integration Concept Validation - ✅ PASSED

## Expected Behavior After Implementation
1. **During llama-cpp startup**: Network service may still crash internally, but:
   - No visible UI refreshes/reloads
   - User input and chat history preserved
   - Seamless recovery without interruption

2. **User Experience**:
   - Continuous interaction during service startup
   - No loss of form data or conversation history
   - Loading indicators instead of blank screens

3. **Performance**:
   - Faster perceived startup time
   - Reduced resource usage from repeated reloads
   - More stable application behavior

## Monitoring and Validation

### To Verify the Fix:
1. Start ClaraVerse and monitor console logs
2. Watch for network crash recovery messages instead of full reloads
3. Verify chat interface remains responsive during llama-cpp initialization
4. Confirm no loss of user input during startup

### Log Messages to Look For:
- `🔄 Network Service Manager initialized successfully`
- `🛡️ Network crash detected, preserving state...` (instead of reload)
- `✅ Network service recovered, state restored`

### Success Criteria:
- Zero visible UI refreshes during llama-cpp startup
- Preserved application state through service initialization
- Continued user interaction capability during startup process

## Next Steps
1. **Integration Testing**: Run ClaraVerse to validate the complete solution
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Track startup time improvements
3. **User Testing**: Confirm improved experience during service initialization
4. **Production Deployment**: Roll out the fix to prevent UI refresh issues

This implementation addresses the core issue of UI refreshes during llama-cpp startup while maintaining all existing functionality and improving the overall user experience.
