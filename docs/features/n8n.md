**What if you could automate any digital workflow without paying for Zapier's expensive plans or learning complex programming?**

While Zapier charges $20-600/month for workflow automation, n8n integrated into ClaraVerse gives you unlimited workflow creation with enterprise-grade featuresâ€”completely free and running on your own infrastructure.

**Enterprise workflow automation. Zero subscription fees. Infinite possibilities.**

## Why n8n?

Let me explain why I built this into ClaraVerse. n8n has all the nodes you need to connect your emails, apps, and anything that requires authentication or security. Honestly, I didnâ€™t want to reinvent the wheel or be responsible for handling everyoneâ€™s security and credentials. So I decided to use n8n for all those integrations.

Hereâ€™s the magic: Once you set up your connections and workflows in n8n, you can turn them into tools for Clara Assistant, add them to your agents, or even use them as backends for LumaUI projects. Youâ€™re free to create whatever you want and attach it anywhere in ClaraVerseâ€”whether itâ€™s automating notifications, syncing data, or building custom backend logic.

Thatâ€™s what n8n does in ClaraVerse: itâ€™s your universal connector, letting you build, automate, and integrate anything, anywhere, without worrying about the hard parts.

## Personal Tips & Real Examples

Hereâ€™s how I use n8n myself, and why I think youâ€™ll love it:

- **Email Notebook Automation**: I connect my email, read the 10â€“20 most recent messages, and automatically create a notebook I can refer to later. Itâ€™s perfect for tracking important updates or project info.
- **Tool Creation**: I turn these email workflows into Clara tools, so I can trigger them anytime or let agents use them in bigger automations.
- **Sidebar Tool Builder**: In n8nâ€™s sidebar, you can create new tools for Clara Assistant or agentsâ€”just a few clicks and youâ€™re done.
- **Workflow Gallery**: The ClaraVerse Store is packed with ready-made workflows. Just copy, use, and customize them for your needs. The store will expand to include even more resources soon!

n8n is open source, flexible, and beautiful. I embedded it in ClaraVerse because it does everything I couldnâ€™t build myselfâ€”and itâ€™s the best way to automate anything you can imagine.

## How It Works in ClaraVerse

- **Embedded UI**: n8n runs right inside ClaraVerse, so you donâ€™t need to leave the app to build or manage workflows.
- **Service Detection**: ClaraVerse automatically finds your n8n instance (Docker or manual) and connects to it. If itâ€™s not running, youâ€™ll get a helpful startup modal.
- **Live Status**: See if n8n is running, refresh the view, and open n8n in your browser for advanced features or authentication.
