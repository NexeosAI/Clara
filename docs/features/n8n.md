# N8N

Workflow automation through a visual interface, integrated into ClaraVerse.

## What N8N Is

N8N is an open-source workflow automation tool (like Zapier but self-hosted). We embedded it in ClaraVerse to handle external integrations - things that need authentication, API keys, OAuth, etc. It runs as a Docker container or you can bring your own instance.

## Why N8N?

Honest answer: Building secure integrations for every service (Gmail, Slack, Discord, databases) would take forever and handling everyone's credentials is a security nightmare. N8N already does this well, so we integrated it instead of reinventing the wheel.

## Setup Requirements

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# N8N runs automatically when you start it from ClaraVerse
# Just need Docker installed and running
```

### Option 2: External N8N
```bash
# Run your own N8N instance
npm install n8n -g
n8n start
# Then point ClaraVerse to http://localhost:5678
```

## How It Works in ClaraVerse

1. **Embedded View**: N8N UI appears inside ClaraVerse
2. **Service Detection**: Auto-finds N8N instance
3. **Tool Creation**: Convert workflows to Clara tools
4. **Webhook Integration**: Expose workflows as endpoints

## Creating Clara Tools from N8N

This is the killer feature - any N8N workflow becomes a Clara Assistant tool:

### Step-by-Step:
1. Create workflow in N8N
2. Add Webhook trigger node
3. Build your automation
4. Test the webhook
5. In ClaraVerse sidebar: "Create Tool"
6. Name it (lowercase_with_underscores)
7. Clara can now use this tool

### Example: Email Checker Tool
```
N8N Workflow:
Webhook → Gmail Node → Format Data → Response

In Clara:
"Check my email for urgent messages"
[Clara automatically uses your email tool]
```

## Common Workflows

### Email to Notebook
```
Trigger: Schedule (daily)
Gmail → Get Messages → Format → HTTP Request to ClaraVerse
Result: Daily email summaries in your notebook
```

### Slack Notifications
```
Trigger: Webhook from Clara
Format Message → Slack Node → Send Message
Usage: Clara can send Slack messages
```

### Database Queries
```
Trigger: Webhook
Parse Query → Database Node → Format Results
Usage: Clara queries your database
```

## N8N Nodes You'll Use Most

- **Webhook**: Entry point for Clara tools
- **HTTP Request**: Call APIs and services
- **Gmail/Outlook**: Email operations
- **Slack/Discord**: Messaging
- **Google Sheets**: Spreadsheet operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
- **Schedule**: Cron-based triggers

## Authentication in N8N

For OAuth and authenticated services:
1. Click "Open in Browser" button
2. N8N opens in your default browser
3. Authenticate services there
4. Return to ClaraVerse - connections persist

## Performance & Limits

- Webhook response time: 1-5 seconds typical
- Maximum workflow time: 5 minutes (configurable)
- Concurrent workflows: Depends on system resources
- Memory per workflow: ~100MB average

## Integration Points

### With Clara Assistant
```javascript
// Your N8N webhook becomes:
Tool: check_emails
Description: "Checks Gmail for new messages"
// Clara uses it automatically when relevant
```

### With Agents
- Trigger N8N workflows from Agent nodes
- Use N8N results in Agent workflows
- Combine for complex automations

### With Notebooks
- Auto-import data to notebooks
- Trigger workflows when notebooks update
- Build knowledge management pipelines

## Common Issues & Solutions

**N8N Won't Start**
```bash
# Check if port 5678 is in use
lsof -i :5678  # Mac/Linux
netstat -ano | findstr :5678  # Windows

# Kill existing process if needed
```

**Webhook Not Working**
- Ensure N8N is running
- Check webhook URL is correct
- Test in N8N interface first
- Verify firewall allows connections

**Authentication Issues**
- Use browser mode for OAuth
- Check credentials are saved
- Refresh tokens may expire

## Real Use Cases

### Customer Support Automation
```
Email arrives → Extract content → Check knowledge base → 
Generate response → Send reply → Log to database
```

### Social Media Pipeline
```
Schedule trigger → Generate content with Clara → 
Create image → Post to platforms → Track engagement
```

### Data Sync
```
Database change → Transform data → Update Google Sheets → 
Notify team → Update notebook
```

## Limitations

1. **Complexity**: N8N learning curve for advanced workflows
2. **External Dependencies**: Relies on external services being available
3. **Debugging**: Complex workflows can be hard to debug
4. **Rate Limits**: Subject to external API limits
5. **Authentication**: Some services require re-authentication periodically

## Pro Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Basic webhook → action → response
2. **Test in N8N First**: Before creating Clara tools
3. **Use Descriptive Names**: "fetch_customer_data" not "tool1"
4. **Handle Errors**: Add error handling nodes
5. **Log Everything**: Use N8N's logging for debugging
6. **Version Control**: Export workflows as JSON for backup

## Security Considerations

- Credentials stored in N8N's database (encrypted)
- Webhooks are public endpoints - use authentication if needed
- API keys in workflows - never share workflow exports
- Run N8N locally for maximum security

## Getting Started

1. Start N8N from ClaraVerse Settings
2. Create simple webhook workflow:
   - Webhook trigger
   - Set node (return "Hello World")
3. Test webhook with curl or browser
4. Create Clara tool from webhook
5. Ask Clara to use your tool

## Advanced: Custom N8N Nodes

You can add custom nodes for ClaraVerse-specific operations:
```javascript
// Place in n8n/custom folder
// Adds ClaraVerse-specific functionality
```

Remember: N8N handles the messy parts (auth, APIs, scheduling) so Clara can focus on intelligence. It's not pretty, but it works and saves months of development.
