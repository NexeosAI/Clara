![Mascot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/badboysm890/ClaraVerse/main/assets/icons/notebook-mascot.png)

**What if your documents could think, connect, and answer questions like a research assistant who never forgets?**

Notebooks powered by LightRAG transform static document storage into an intelligent, living knowledge system. While companies charge $20+/month for basic document AI, you get unlimited document processing, 3D knowledge visualization, and conversational document interaction‚Äîall running privately on your machine.

**This isn't just document storage. It's your second brain, externalized and supercharged.**

## üöÄ Revolutionary Features

**üß† LightRAG Integration**: Advanced retrieval augmented generation wrapped in our custom container‚Äîenterprise-grade document AI without the enterprise price tag.

**üåê 3D Knowledge Visualization**: See your knowledge as an interactive 3D network. Watch how concepts connect, identify knowledge gaps, and explore your data like never before.

**üí¨ Conversational Documents**: Don't just search your files‚Äîhave conversations with them. Ask questions, get summaries, and extract insights naturally.

**üîÑ Living Knowledge Base**: Connect agents to keep your notebooks automatically updated. Email summaries, research reports, meeting notes‚Äîall processed and integrated while you sleep.

**üîó Clara Ecosystem Integration**: Your notebooks become Clara's memory. She references them in conversations, agents use them for context, and your entire workspace becomes smarter.

- **Powered by LightRAG:** The heart of Notebooks is LightRAG, wrapped in our custom container for easy deployment and optimized performance, giving you fast, accurate, and context-rich answers from your own documents.
- **Standalone & Flexible:** Use Notebooks independently‚Äîcreate, upload, and manage documents, then chat directly with your data. Make changes, organize, and interact however you like.
- **Conversational Interface:** Speak with your notebook! Ask questions, get summaries, and let the AI help you understand your content.
- **3D Data Visualization:** Visualize your data in 3D‚Äîsee how your documents are stored, connected, and processed. It‚Äôs not just functional, it‚Äôs fun.
- **Clara Assistant Integration:** Attach your notebook to Clara Assistant. She can reference your notebooks, fetch information, and even automate tasks for you.
- **Personalization:** Set wallpapers, organize by topic, and make your workspace truly yours.
- **Agent Integration & Automation (v0.1.45):** Create agents and connect APIs to your notebooks, keeping them alive and automatically updated. Automate daily tasks‚Äîlike fetching emails, converting them to PDFs, and storing them in your notebook. Your notebook becomes a living, self-updating memory.

## How I Use Notebooks (Personal Tips)

- I create a notebook for every major research project, then drop in PDFs, notes, and web clippings. RAG lets me ask questions and get instant answers from my own data.
- The backend health check means I never waste time troubleshooting‚Äîif something‚Äôs down, I get a friendly prompt to restart.
- I use the wallpaper feature to set a calming background, making long research sessions more enjoyable.
- The document status tracker helps me keep tabs on large imports, so I know exactly when my data is ready for querying.
- I love the 3D view‚Äîit helps me see how my knowledge is organized and spot gaps or connections I might miss otherwise.
- Clara Assistant can use my notebooks to answer questions, automate workflows, and even summarize meeting notes for me.
- I set up agents to connect my email inbox to a notebook, so every day new emails are fetched, converted to PDFs, and stored automatically. My notebook stays up-to-date without manual effort.

## Real Examples

- **Research Notebook:** I created a ‚ÄúGenAI Trends‚Äù notebook, uploaded whitepapers, and now use RAG to summarize and answer questions for my blog.
- **Project Management:** For my team, each project gets its own notebook. We drop in meeting notes, specs, and use RAG to find decisions and action items.
- **Personal Knowledge Base:** I keep a ‚ÄúLife Hacks‚Äù notebook with recipes, travel tips, and more‚ÄîRAG makes it searchable and fun.
- **Clara Assistant Integration:** I ask Clara to pull info from my notebooks, draft emails, or automate repetitive research tasks. It‚Äôs like having a super-powered personal assistant.
- **Agent Automation:** My "Daily Reports" notebook is updated every morning by an agent that fetches new data from APIs, emails, and other sources‚Äîno manual work required.

## Known Issues & Tips

- If the backend is down, you‚Äôll see a startup modal‚Äîjust follow the prompts to get going.
- Large document imports may take a while; check the status tracker for progress.
- For best results, use high-quality documents and keep your notebooks organized by topic.
- The 3D view is best experienced with well-organized data‚Äîtry grouping related documents for clearer visualization.
- Clara Assistant works best when your notebooks are up-to-date and well-labeled.
- Agent automation requires Docker as a prerequisite, and the full feature set (including voice) may need up to 8GB of space.
