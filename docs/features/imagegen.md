**What if you could generate unlimited professional images without ever worrying about credits, subscriptions, or monthly bills?**

While Midjourney charges $10-60/month and DALL-E burns through credits, ImageGen gives you unlimited AI image generation running locally on your hardware. We've wrapped ComfyUIâ€”the gold standard of AI image generationâ€”into a seamless, one-click experience.

**Professional AI art generation. Zero ongoing costs. Complete creative freedom.**
